violation charges and animal-removal charges are liquidated

damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead (except for

attorney's fees and litigation costs) in enforcing animal restrictions

and rules. We may remove an unauthorized animal by (1) leaving,

in a conspicuous place in the apartment, a 24-hour written notice

of intent to remove the animal, and (2) following the procedures

of paragraph 29 (When We May Enter). We may keep or kennel the

animal or turn it over to a humane society or local authority. When

keeping or kenneling an animal, we won't be liable for loss, harm,

sickness, or death of the animal unless due to our negligence. We'll

return the animal to you upon request if it has not already been

turned over to a humane society or local authority. You must pay

for the animal's reasonable care and kenneling charges. We have

no lien on the animal for any purpose.

29. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. §83.53, we may

enter the dwelling unit at any time for the protection or preservation

of the premises, in the case of an emergency, or if you unreasonably

withhold consent. If you or any guest or occupant is present, then

repairers, servicers, contractors, our representatives or other

persons listed in (2) below may peacefully enter the apartment at

reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below. If nobody is

in the apartment, then such persons may enter peacefully and at

reasonable times by duplicate or master key (or by breaking a

window or other means when necessary in emergencies) if:

(1) we provide you with written notice to enter at least 24 hours

prior to the entry to take place between the hours of 7:30 a.m.

and 8:00 p.m.; and

(2) entry is for: responding to your request; making repairs or

replacements; estimating repair or refurbishing costs;

performing pest control; doing preventive maintenance;

and severally liable for all lease obligations. If you or any guest or

occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are

considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Our requests and

notices (including sale notices) to any resident constitute notice to

all residents and occupants. Notices and requests from any resident

or occupant (including notices of lease termination, repair requests,

and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. In

eviction suits, each resident is considered the agent of all other

residents in the apartment for service of process. Security-deposit

refunds and deduction itemizations of multiple residents will comply

in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the

replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing

resident will no longer have a right to occupancy or a security

deposit refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the

original Lease Contract term unless we agree otherwise in writing—

even if a new Lease Contract is signed.

31. REPLACEMENTS AND SUBLETTING. Replacing a resident, sub-

letting, assignment, or granting a right or license to occupy is

allowed only when we expressly consent in writing.

Procedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement

resident, then, at our option: (1) the replacement resident must

sign this Lease Contract with or without an increase in the total

security deposit; or (2) the remaining and replacement residents

nature within a twelve (12) month period, we may terminate

your lease without giving you any further opportunity to cure

the non-compliance as provided above. Examples of non-

compliance in which we will give you an opportunity to cure

the violation include, but are not limited to, unauthorized pets,

guests, or vehicles, parking in an unauthorized manner, or

failing to keep the apartment and premises clean and sanitary.

We will also have all rights under Florida law and this lease to

dwelling unit, double the amount of rent due for each day that you

continue to holdover and refuse to surrender possession during

the holdover period, breach of contract damages, attorney fees and

court costs as may be applicable; or (3) at our option, we may extend

the Lease Contract term—for up to one month from the date of

notice of Lease Contract extension—by delivering written notice

to you or your apartment while you continue to hold over.

Other Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit

agencies. If we, or a third-party debt collector we use, try to collect

any money you owe us, you agree that we or the debt collector may

call you on your cell phone and may use an automated dialer. If you

default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to

be rental discounts in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), in addition

to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal

remedies under state statute. Unless a party is seeking exemplary,

to re-let it, you will remain liable for the difference between the

rental remaining due under the lease and the amount we are able

to recover by making a good faith effort at re-letting the premises

on your behalf. We are not required to make an election of which

remedies we choose to pursue nor notify you of which remedies

we will select.

Lease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred.

In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the

expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a

default under this Lease, We may, at our sole and absolute discretion,

terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term

has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease

by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said

subsequent Lease.

access to the community. Be sure to do the following when using vehicle gates: a) always

approach all entry / exit gates at a very slow speed; b) never stop your vehicle where the

gate can hit your car as the gate opens or closes; c) never force the gate open with your

car; d) always use your own card and/or remote to gain entry from any gate; e) do not give

your card or remote or code to anyone else; f) do not tamper with the gates; g) the length

and width of a trailer or boat may cause problems with the gate; therefore, contact the

management office for assistance if you are using the gate with a trailer or boat; and h) do

not operate the gate if there are small children close by who might get caught in it as the

gate opens or closes.

Bed bugs increased presence across the United States in recent

decades can be attributed largely to a surge in international

found time and time again to have taken up residence in some

of the fanciest hotels and apartment buildings in some of the

nation’s most expensive neighborhoods.

Nonetheless, false claims that associate bed bugs presence

with poor hygiene and uncleanliness have caused rental

housing residents, out of shame, to avoid notifying owners of

their presence. This serves only to enable the spread of bed

bugs.

While bed bugs are, by their very nature, more attracted to

clutter, they’re certainly not discouraged by cleanliness.

Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention, have refused to elevate bed bugs to the threat

level posed by disease transmitting pests. Again, claims

Bed bugs can often be found in, around and between:

 Bedding

 Bed frames

 Mattress seams

 Upholstered furniture, especially under cushions

and along seams

 Around, behind and under wood furniture, especially

along areas where drawers slide

 Curtains and draperies

 Along window and door frames

 Ceiling and wall junctions

 Crown moldings

 Behind and around wall hangings and loose wallpaper

 Between carpeting and walls (carpet can be pulled

away from the wall and tack strip)

 While bed bugs typically prefer to act at night, they

often do not succeed in returning to their hiding spots

without leaving traces of their presence through fecal

markings of a red to dark brown color, visible on or near

beds. Blood stains tend also to appear when the bugs

have been squashed, usually by an unsuspecting host in

their sleep. And, because they shed, it’s not uncommon

for skin casts to be left behind in areas typically

frequented by bed bugs.

Because humans serve as bed bugs’ main mode of

transportation, it is extremely important to be mindful of bed

bugs when away from home. Experts agree that the spread

of bed bugs across all regions of the United States is largely

attributed to an increase in international travel and trade.

Travelers are therefore encouraged to take a few minutes

upon arriving to their temporary destination to thoroughly

inspect their accommodations, so as to ensure that any

uninvited guests are detected before the decision is made to

unpack.

Because bed bugs can easily travel from one room to another,

it is also recommended that travelers thoroughly inspect their

luggage and belongings for bed bugs before departing for

home.

hereby strictly prohibited from subletting, licensing, or renting

This Addendum constitutes an Addendum to the above

Addendum vary or contradict any terms or conditions found

✙✚✛✚✜✢✣✣✢✤✥✦✧✛✚✜✙✚✛✚✜✢✣✣✢✤★✩✪✚✫✬✭✬✫✢✣✣✮✯✰✚✱✲✧✯✜✲✣✣✚✛
Substances Act (CSA), marijuana is still categorized as a

Schedule I substance. This means that under federal law, the

manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana is

strictly prohibited. Because the U.S. Department of Housing

and Urban Development is controlled by the federal

government, it agrees that the use of marijuana, whether

prescribed for medical reasons or not, is a criminal offense

and will not be protected under the fair housing laws.

Therefore, apartment complexes are not required to

accommodate the use of marijuana by a tenant who is a current

medical marijuana user. Disabled tenants who are registered

medical marijuana users, however, should not feel discouraged

to request reasonable accommodations if the need arises.

4. The Premises listed above follows and complies with federal

law regarding marijuana use and is, and will continue to be,

a drug free community. Possession, use, manufacture or sale

of any illegal substance, including marijuana, or any use of

marijuana by the tenant and/or guests will result in immediate

termination. If you have any questions or concerns about this

policy, please speak to management.

5. By signing below, the resident acknowledges his or her

understanding of the terms and conditions as stated above,

and his or her agreement to comply with those terms and

conditions.

Pest and Rodent Prevention Addendum

It is the goal of the Landlord to provide a quality living environment for all our residents. To help

achieve this goal, it is important we work together to minimize and prevent any pests or rodents in

your apartment. That is why this addendum contains important information for you, as well as

responsibilities for both you and us. This is an Addendum to your Lease.

Pests and rodents can be found virtually everywhere in our environment - both indoor and outdoors

and in both new and old structures. Many states and particularly urban areas have been afflicted with

this problem for many years, particularly since the EPA’s elimination of DDT as a preventative

chemical. Pests such as bed bugs are commonly transported by shoes, clothing, furniture (particularly

used furniture) and other materials. A Landlord cannot timely and permanently eliminate pests and/or

rodents without significant and ongoing Resident cooperation and effort. There is conflicting scientific

evidence as to what contributes or encourages pests and rodents. Nonetheless, appropriate

precautions need to be taken. In order to minimize the potential for pests and rodents in your

Apartment, you must do the following:

 Keep your Apartment clean - particularly the kitchen, the bathroom(s), carpets, linens and floors.

Regularly vacuuming, mopping and using a household cleaner to clean hard surfaces is important

to remove the household dirt/debris that harbors food and substances attractive to certain pests

and rodents. Do not leave food or dirty dishes sitting out. Seal all food in airtight containers.

 If bed bugs or other pests/rodents are detected, Resident agrees to undertake all efforts and tasks

recommended by a qualified expert. With regard to bedbugs, such tasks include but are not

limited to the following: Resident should strip all sheets and linen from all beds, and move all beds

away from walls. Eliminate clutter and vacuum well to initially collect (and kill) as many bedbugs

as possible. Vacuuming efforts should especially focus in and around bedrooms, underneath

beds, around headboards, in mattress crevices and along mattress frame and tracks. All furniture

should be carefully vacuumed as well with a strong vacuum and Resident should promptly

dispose of all vacuum bags in dumpster. Clean out and disinfect all cabinets, drawers and closets.

Use a stiff brush when cleaning to dislodge and destroy any eggs. Remove all clutter that would

prevent effective service. Place all potentially infected clothing in plastic bags and permanently

encase mattresses and box springs within special mattress bags. Resident should remove all

occupants and pets from unit for 3 hours after service. After any pest service, launder all bed

sheets and other linen, as well as any other clothing items that may be infected. Clothes and

linens should be laundered with hot water of at least 140 degrees, and should be laundered at

least several times every couple of days after pest treatment. Resident should vacuum again after

pest service, on a daily basis for the next three days.

It is important to prevent pests and rodents in your Apartment. Resident must promptly report

evidence of pests and rodents in or on apartment surfaces or inside mattresses, walls or ceilings, in

writing to Landlord. If Resident fails to notify Landlord in writing within seven (7) days after move in of

any evidence of pests or rodents, including bed bugs, then it will be presumed the unit was free of

infestation at the time of move in. An infestation of pests or rodents can result from a wide variety of

sources, such as: bringing in used furniture, mattresses, boxes or clothing items which are already

contaminated. Never retrieve any items from or around a dumpster. Never leave potentially infested

items in a common area, on the street or next to a dumpster. Proper disposal is vital to prevent the

spread of pests and rodents. Consult your landlord or a licensed pest control specialist for methods of

proper remediation and/or disposal. If Resident sees evidence or indication of the presence of

pests or rodents (or re-infestation or indications that treatment has been ineffective), Resident

shall immediately notify Landlord in writing of these problems.

Resident will keep the Apartment clean and take other measures to prevent and eliminate pests and

rodents in the Apartment, including but not limited to measures as set forth in the Lease and this

Addendum. Resident agrees to undertake all efforts and tasks recommended by a qualified expert.

Upon written notification from Resident regarding signs of pests and/or rodents, Landlord shall, within

a reasonable time frame, make arrangements for appropriate spraying and any other pest or rodent

remediation deemed appropriate, in accordance with State law, the Lease and this Addendum,

provided such infestation was not caused by the misuse or neglect of Resident, or any occupants or

guests of Resident.

A breach of this Addendum by Resident shall be a material and substantial violation of the Lease

(non-curable) allowing Landlord to recover possession of the apartment, following a Notice to Quit in

accordance with the State law, and all other rights and remedies contained in the Lease. Resident

shall be liable for all resulting costs and damages for violation including but not limited to costs of

extermination and the damages caused by the spreading of such pest or rodent infestation. In the

event of a breach of this Addendum by Landlord, Resident’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be to

immediately vacate the Apartment and Resident’s obligations to continue to pay rent shall terminate

on the date Resident delivers possession of the Apartment to Landlord. Landlord shall in no event be

liable for consequential damages such as damages to Resident’s personal property, or claims of

adverse health conditions associated with exposure to pests or rodents. Resident hereby releases

Landlord from any and all claims of Resident for the presence of pests or rodents in the Apartment,

including all claims of consequential damages such as damages to Resident’s personal property, or

claims of adverse health conditions associated with exposure to pests or rodents.

Community Rules and Regulations

Lease Addendum

This Lease Addendum is attached to and made a part of your lease.

Welcome to your new home professionally managed by JRK Residential Group. We hope these community policies acquaint you

with the many services and facilities available to you. It’s the goal of JRK Residential Group to maintain a community where all

residents are proud to call home. The management office is open to serve you and we request your assistance in maintaining high

standards for your community.

Residents and all occupants, including children, adults, and guests, must comply with all policies regarding use of the resident’s

dwelling and the common areas. There are policies contained in the lease and separate policies attached to the lease or provided to

the resident(s) during the lease term. For purposes of this acknowledgement, “owner” includes the dwelling owner named in your

lease, JRK Residential Group and their respective partners, employees, officers, directors, agents and servants. “Lease” means the

Lease Contract between owner and resident(s). “Home” means the apartment, town home, or space leased from owner including

garages.

The owner does not promise or warrant that owner will be aware of crime that happens in the area or even on the property.

Owner will try to notify the residents when owner becomes aware of a serious crime on the property with written notice attached

to resident’s front door.

Owner reserves the right to reduce, modify or eliminate any security system; security devices or service (other than those statutorily

required) at any time and without notice; and such action shall not be a breach of any obligation or warranty on the part of the

owner.

Construction. In the event that the apartment community is under construction. Resident agrees to observe all warning signs and

blockades and stay away from the construction areas. Construction crews work throughout the days during the week and on

weekends in order to complete construction. Areas of construction will have machinery and equipment to be used by authorized

personnel only and entry into these areas by Resident, occupants of the Unit, or their respective guests is strictly prohibited.

Maintenance. Emergency maintenance service is provided 24 hours a day by calling. Qualified maintenance personnel are on duty

to handle most problems that may arise. Please be considerate when requesting after hours maintenance. If the situation can wait

until the management office opens, please wait and call or leave a message with the answering service. Routine maintenance calls

are taken during normal office hours. Any situation of potential property damage or resident injury is considered an emergency.

Management personnel will be contacted. Owner reserves the right to determine whether a maintenance situation is an emergency.

Furnace related calls will only be considered an emergency when the temperature inside the apartment is below 65 degrees. This

provision shall not be construed as a waiver by Owner to require written notice of any repair requests. Resident acknowledges that

this pertains to maintenance requests only. Resident agrees to contact the local law enforcement agency in the event of security

related concerns. It is the resident’s responsibility to check the A/C filter at least once a month. If the filter is not replaced regularly,

it can clog up and cause your A/C to work less efficiently, eventually freeze up and flood your apartment and/or the apartment

below you. On the first service call of this nature, you will receive a warning to change your filter. On any subsequent visits you will

be charged $50. Any failure to report a maintenance problem that causes damage to resident’s apartment or other apartments will

result in a charge for repair.

Laundry Rooms. If your property provides laundry rooms, the rooms will be operated by a commercial company. A repair

number is posted in the laundry facility and may be called for repair service and refunds. Please help keep the laundry room

clean.

Obstructions & Trash. Keep all sidewalks, entrances, passageways and stairways around the property free from obstructions.

Keep trash in its proper place. Trash receptacles are located on the community grounds. A charge of $50 will be levied for anyone

placing trash in any area not designated for refuse disposal. Large or bulky items should not be placed around or in dumpsters. Call

the Management Office and arrangements will be made for it to be picked. There will be a charge based on costs.

Patios & Balconies. Please keep patios/balconies clean. Patio/balconies are to be used for patio furniture and plants.

Patios/balconies are not to be used for storage. Garbage bags, garbage receptacles, bicycles, toys, clotheslines or clothes hanging

over balcony rails, and similar items are unsightly as well as fire hazards. The property prohibits the use of any grill, hibachi or

smoker within 10 feet of the building or overhang. Any person violating this code or failing to comply with it is subject to a $50 fine

and may be in default of their lease.

Vehicles & Parking. Motor homes, large trucks, boats, boat trailers, inoperable vehicles and other similar vehicles may not be

parked on the premises. All such prohibited vehicles will be parked outside the area. This does not apply to service vehicles of

contractors or other persons performing service for residents. Vehicles which are otherwise prohibited may be temporarily parked for

the purpose of loading or unloading. Only those vehicles registered with the Management Office as belonging to residents are

permitted on property. Additional vehicles are unauthorized. All vehicles MUST: 1) Be fully operable and in reasonably undamaged

condition 2) Have current, valid registration 3) Have visible, valid inspection stickers.

Pets. If a pet is acquired after residency is established, it should be reported immediately to management and an Animal

Addendum established. Failure to report an acquired pet could result in eviction. Those pets that are vicious or have annoying

habits will not be allowed to stay. PETS MUST BE ON A LEASH AT ALL TIMES WHEN NOT IN APARTMENT. Unleashed pets or

pets roaming free may be transported to an animal control facility. In consideration of and for the welfare of other residents, it is

necessary that pets be walked along the outer perimeter of the property. PLEASE CLEAN UP ALL PET DROPPINGS. A $75 fine

will be assessed if your pet is not on a leash or if pet droppings are not picked up.

Noise. Apartment living necessitates consideration for one’s neighbors. Therefore, thoughtfulness and good judgment should be

used in controlling noise which might be offensive to others. The use of sound equipment (television, radios, stereos, etc.) should be

kept at a level that is inaudible outside the individual apartment. Be considerate when playing car stereos while driving in and out of

the complex, especially during the evening hours.

Mail and Packages. Mail is to be delivered in accordance with postal regulations to your mailbox. Notify the post office of your

apartment number. Management cannot be held responsible for packages or mail left in the business office. Packages are accepted

as a courtesy to the residents. They will be held for three days only and only small packages will be accepted. Large packages or

more than three packages delivered at once, per apartment, cannot be accepted without prior consent. Therefore, any large

package or bulk deliveries will be returned to the Post Office or UPS for pick-up.

Apartment Keys. During normal business hours, the management office will allow residents entry into their home upon verifying

photo identification against the least file. At properties discretion, lock-outs after office hours will require a $75 charge paid at the

time access to a unit is provided. If the key is not returned, there will be a charge for new keys and locks. Management must have a

key to your apartment. Additional locks may be added to your door ONLY with the permission of the resident manager, and must

be installed by the management maintenance staff. A lock change will be provided for $75.00 and will be completed after payment

is received. Owner does not provide after-hour lockouts service or key duplications after move-in. Lost key replacement will be at a

$15 charge.

Transfer. Transfer of units is only allowed to occur when the resident has resided in the apartment a minimum of 6 months and has

given proper notice for the terms of their lease. The transfer must be approved by Owner (Resident cannot be in violation of this Lease

and must be approved). If Owner approves the transfer, Resident will need to sign a new lease, complete applicable paperwork, pay

any applicable fees and pay a New Security Deposit. After Owner has inspected the Unit, the appropriate portion of the Resident’s

original Security Deposit will be refunded in accordance with applicable law.

PET ADDENDUM
Property: ____________________________

Unit No.: ____________________________

Lease Contract Date: ____________________________

Residents (list all): ____________________________ ____________________________

____________________________ ____________________________

Under penalty of perjury, I, ____________________________ hereby certify that I:

______ have a pet or pets, have notified the Owner of the existence of my met or pets and have agreed to the

rules, terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum and the Lease Agreement

______ do not have a pet or pets (as further set forth below) and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in

this Addendum and the Lease Agreement, including, without limitation, the Pet Liquidated Damages (as

hereinafter defined).

Pet Rent. I agree that I shall pay Pet Rent each month along side my rent totaling $_________. Failure to pay such

rent will be treated as a failure to pay rent and will subject me to all rights and remedies set forth in the Lease,

including, without limitation, eviction. In the event the above amount is not filled in, Pet Rent shall equal the

amount set forth in the Special Provisions of the Lease Agreement. In the event of conflict between the two, this

Addendum shall govern.

Pet Deposit. I agree to pay a Pet Fee equal to $________ and / or a Pet Deposit equal to $_________. This

amount shall be due prior to move in and shall be subject to all rights, terms and conditions set forth in the Lease

Agreement. In the event the above amount is not filled in, Pet Fee and / or Pet Deposit shall equal the amount set

forth in the Special Provisions of the Lease Agreement. In the event of conflict between the two, this Addendum

shall govern.

Liquidated Damages. The possession of a pet requires Owner to incur certain costs and expenses related to

maintenance, cleaning and insurance. By failing to disclose a pet, Resident has breached this Addendum and

forced Owner to incur these and other costs. The Parties to this Addendum agree that the damages Owner will

incur are difficult or impossible to calculate and thus the parties have agreed that an amount equal to six (6)

months of the then current prevailing Pet Rent at the Community plus two (2) times the standard Pet Rent and /

or Pet Deposit is a fair and accurate estimation of these damages. In the event Owner determines that Resident

has violated this Addendum by failing to disclose a pet or pets, Resident shall pay the Liquidated Damages set forth

herein immediately.

7. REPORT DAMAGE OR MALFUNCTION. Please immediately report to the office any malfunction or damage to locks, fobs,

cards, or related equipment.

8. FOLLOW RULES IN USING FOB, CODE, OR CARD. We ask that you and your guests follow instructions for the fob or card.

This is important because if the lock is damaged by you or your guests through negligence or misuse, you are liable for the

damages under your lease, and collection of damage amounts will be pursued.

9. PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE. Except as specifically required by law, we have no duty to

maintain the locks and cannot guaranty against malfunctions. We make no representations or guarantees to you concerning

security of the community or amenities. Any measures or devices taken by us are solely for the benefit of us and for the

protection of our property and interests, and any benefit to you or the same is purely incidental. Anything mechanical or

electronic is subject to malfunction. Locks, gates, fencing, or other devices will not prevent all crime. No security system or

device is foolproof or 100 percent successful in deterring crime. Protecting residents, their families, occupants, guests and

invitees from crime is the sole responsibility of residents, occupants and law enforcement agencies. You should first call 911 or

other appropriate emergency police numbers if a crime occurs or is suspected. We are not liable to pay any resident, family

member, guest, occupant, or invitee for personal injury, death or damage/loss of personal property from incidents related to

perimeter fencing and/or access gates or locks. We reserve the right to modify or eliminate security systems other than those

statutorily required. You will be held responsible for the actions or any persons to whom you provide access to the community

and amenities.

EACH TENANT SHOULD NOT SIGN THIS ADDENDUM UNTIL EACH TENANT UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS IN

THIS ADDENDUM.

This Addendum to Residential Rental Agreement is made this 07/22/2022, and is incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and

supplement the Residential Rental Agreement (Lease) made by the undersigned Tenant and Landlord, their heirs, successors and

assigns, dated 07/21/2022. The Residential Rental Agreement (Lease) and this Addendum pertain to the premises described in said

Additional Covenants and Obligations

SNOW and ICE REMOVAL

Unless otherwise specified, snow and ice removal from walkways and driveways is provided by landlord or management as a courtesy

only and is not guaranteed. Tenants understand that due to unpredictable weather, the Landlord, manager, or agent thereof may not be

able to have the snow plowed or the walkways shoveled before weather conditions require precaution. Tenants need to be aware that

the roads, parking lots and walkways may be slippery any time the weather is or has been inclement—even if the walkways have been

shoveled and the driveways plowed. Tenants and their guests (whether expressed or implied) agree to hold Landlord, manager or any

agent thereof harmless for any accidents caused by inclement weather. Tenants are solely responsible for snow removal from

individual parking spaces.

You assume for yourself and all members of your family and your guests, any and all risks from any accidents in connection with use of

the premises, the property, or the property’s recreational facilities or areas, it being understood that all such areas and facilities are

gratuitously supplied for your use, and at the user’s sole risk.

THE UNDERSIGNED ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE/HE HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT, THAT SHE/HE FULLY

UNDERSTANDS ITS FINAL AND BINDING EFFECT, AND THAT SHE/HE IS SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY.
